# iOS Fat Static frameworks for all XIPH open source libs
Compiled static fat libraries for libopus/libopusenc/libspeexdsp/libshout/libogg/libvorbis for iOS including headers.

Static fat libs work for all archs including i386 x86_64 armv7 armv7s arm64 (simulator/real device/etc).

Let me know if you ever want me to rebuild any of these libs for updates or build a separate Xiph lib into a static lib! Of course, let me know if you have any other issues.

The header files for these libs are included in the `include` directory.
